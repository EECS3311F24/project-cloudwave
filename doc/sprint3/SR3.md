Analysis:

Good Practices:

Regular Feedback Loops:
Regular feedback sessions after each goal allowed the team to refine the features gradually. 
This ensured that issues were identified early and resolved efficiently.

Cross-Function Collaboration:
Collaboration between frontend and backend teams was strong. Each team member regularly reviewed 
and provided feedback on each others work, ensuring all parts of the application fit together smoothly.

Emphasis on User Testing:
Additional user experience testing was conducted to ensure ease of use when users interact with the 
navigation buttons. This improved the overall flow and ease of use of the application.

Areas for Improvement:

Time Management in Testing:
More time was spent on feature implementation than initially planned, which reduced the time available
for comprehensive testing. Better time allocation would have allowed for more thorough end-to-end testing.

Time Allocation:
More time should have been allocated to refining the appearance of the progression bar and reminders. 
Additional polish would have enhanced the visual appeal.

Handling Edge Cases for Notifications
Some rare cases, such as reminders for tasks with no due date, were not fully handled. Better planning for 
these scenarios would improve functionality.
