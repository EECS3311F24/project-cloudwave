[November 4, 2024] - Sprint 2 Standup 1
Najwa:

What did you work on since the last standup?
I worked on the backend logic for the Timer functionality, implementing the start, pause, and reset methods. 
I also started designing the database schema for storing time logs.

What do you commit to next?
I’ll continue working on the Timer feature, focusing on finalizing the backend methods and ensuring the 
database properly logs time for tasks.

When do you think you'll be done?
I expect to have the Timer feature completed within the next two days.

Do you have any blockers?
I'm having difficulty with properly logging the time in the database, especially with concurrent tasks. I’ll 
need to research solutions for that.

Najwa:

What did you work on since the last standup?
I worked on extending the Task class to include a due date attribute and integrated the due date 
functionality into the backend.

What do you commit to next?
I will focus on testing the Timer feature and finishing up unit tests for the due date functionality.

When do you think you'll be done?
I expect to complete testing and unit tests by the end of tomorrow.

Do you have any blockers?
The integration between the frontend and backend for due date display is slightly delayed due to some 
UI alignment issues. I'll work with Hamzah on this.

Hamzah:

What did you work on since the last standup?
I focused on designing the frontend for the Timer widget, including adding buttons for start, pause, and reset. 
I also integrated the visual timer display.

What do you commit to next?
I will now start working on the frontend integration for the due date functionality, adding a calendar input
to select a due date for tasks.

When do you think you'll be done?
I expect to complete the due date frontend integration in the next two days.

Do you have any blockers?
The calendar input component isn't rendering correctly, and I need to look into a compatibility issue 
between the component and the existing task layout.

I’ll finish up the due date calendar input integration and ensure that the selected due date is displayed 
properly on the task page.

When do you think you'll be done?
