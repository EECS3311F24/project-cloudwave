Sprint Retrospective (SR2.md)

Analysis:

Good Practices:

Efficient Task Delegation: Tasks were distributed effectively based on team members' strengths. 
Najwa focused on implementing the backend logic for the Timer and Due Date features, while Hamzah 
took charge of integrating the UI for the timer widget and the due date calendar input, ensuring a user-friendly 
interface. Abdihakim handled the testing and debugging of the backend features and assisted with front-end testing 
to ensure all components worked seamlessly together.

Regular Updates: Daily stand-ups allowed the team to maintain alignment on progress, identify blockers early, 
and collaboratively resolve issues, ensuring that the project moved forward smoothly without delays.

Task Tracking: We used Trello to track and manage user stories effectively. Tasks were clearly defined with detailed 
descriptions and assigned appropriate priority, enabling efficient tracking and task completion.

Areas for Improvement:

Clarifying User Stories: Some user stories could have been more detailed, especially regarding edge cases like what 
should happen if a timer is paused and resumed or how overdue notifications should behave in different scenarios 
(e.g., when multiple tasks are overdue). A clearer specification of these scenarios would have helped us avoid ambiguity 
during implementation.

Testing Depth: While we implemented unit tests for individual features (Timer and Due Date), we could have written more 
comprehensive integration tests to test the interaction between the backend and frontend, such as ensuring that the timer 
updates in real-time and that due date notifications trigger correctly across different user interactions.
