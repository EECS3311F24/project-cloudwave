Motivation
This project is a To-do list Java GUI application. 
The motivation behind this project stems from a desire to create a task management tool that goes beyond traditional to-do lists by addressing not just productivity but also emotional well-being.
Many existing to-do list applications focus solely on maximising efficiency, often overlooking the user's mental state or capacity to take on certain tasks. 
This app solves the problem of rigid task prioritisation by introducing a Mood-Based Task Suggestion system, where users can select their current mood (e.g., productive, stressed, relaxed), and the app will suggest tasks accordingly. 
The goal is to provide a more personalised and empathetic experience, helping users manage their tasks in a way that aligns with how they feel in the moment. 
By catering to usersâ€™ emotional needs, the app fosters a healthier balance between productivity and well-being, making it an essential tool for those who want to maintain high performance without sacrificing mental health. 
This project exists because task management should be adaptive, not just to deadlines, but also to the user's capacity and energy levels.
